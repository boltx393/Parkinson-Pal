# Parkinson's Disease Prediction

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict if a patient has Parkinson's disease based on audio/voice measurements. By analyzing a dataset with multiple voice features, the project aims to build an accurate model for early detection, supporting healthcare providers with diagnostic insights.

## Features

- Processes and analyzes patient voice data for Parkinson's disease prediction.
- Utilizes machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
- Evaluates model accuracy using metrics and visualization techniques.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/parkinsons-disease-prediction.git
   cd parkinsons-disease-prediction
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Train and test the model using various classifiers.
3. Evaluate the model's performance and visualize the results.
